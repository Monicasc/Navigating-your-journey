The young generation	
Many young people are home during this time. How might they navigate this time and what can they engage themselves in.
These are the times when the young people can come up with youth groups that volunteers to support the vulnerable like the aged who might not be able to help themselve.since  corona is here with us and the government is still thinking of ways to manage it,here is time and best opportunity for   young people to come up with ideas that can help in managing this virus in Kenya.Also they can use their creative skills  or talents that is outside book work to keep themselves busy and not get their brains corrupt with unnecessary activities like smoking,early relationships that can lead to unwanted early pregnancies,watching ponographic movies that can create an ‘urge of experimenting’ since we are in the era of great exposure to  the new technology that is growing really faster annually.
Keeping them busy also by opening free forums that allows play a role in their communities, like tree planting sessions,creating awareness about the deadly virus and instilling positive mindset amongst themselves.Also there are those young people coming from remote areas who might not be that exposed to some life skills education,this could be an opportunity to invite the other youths from towns.

Introduction to christianity-The colonists introduced christianity in Africa by sending missionaries to different parts of African countries that quickly grew and Africans were  deeply into christianity,which has grown spread widely over time.
Introduction to education-Before the colonists came,there was the formal education where the grandparents took the initiative to teach the young ones about what duties and roles they would play at different stages of their lives.The colonists came up the formal education where Africans were able to read,write and go to high level  of learning to colleges,universities and graduate.This enabled Africans get exposed and also take part in workplaces during that time.Education system in Africa is  growing rapidly and a larger population in Africa are educated.
Taking african land to conduct their own commercial use,in kenya they took te best fertile lands in the central regions and did farm work for their own benefits,Africans were forced to work on their lands  and mistreating them,raping women,corpral punishment and low wages,which made African lost the right to own their lands and be productive.They also took lands in SouthAfrica and Congo for mining gold and started  their companies.In some African countries there are still facing  issues of  land grabbing which has caused a lot of conflicts for many years which came up due to colonial effects.
Africans were forced to leave their cultural practices and values to start adapting to the western culture which brought about the extincity of the cultural values which promoted unity,bond and socialisation.With time,many African cultures will not be in the picture.
