<h1>More About Me</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m a people-person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground with strangers, and I like making people feel comfortable in my presence. I find this skill is especially helpful and applying them on my career path.</p>
